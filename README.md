# Linear Regression Project

This repository contains code and resources for implementing and exploring linear regression models. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and various utilities to facilitate the analysis and development of linear regression algorithms.

## Contents

- **data/**: Contains raw and processed datasets.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, model building, and evaluation.
- **src/**: Source code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **tests/**: Unit tests for ensuring code reliability and correctness.
- **requirements.txt**: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6+
- Necessary libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   
   git clone https://github.com/mazimum86/LinearRegression.git
   cd LinearRegression

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   
   '''bash
   
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scripts\activate`
   
3. Install the required dependencies:
 
  '''bash

   pip install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
## Data Preprocessing
Scripts for data preprocessing can be found in the src/data_preprocessing.py file. Use these scripts to clean and prepare your data for modeling.

## Model Training
The `src/model_training.py` file contains scripts for training the linear regression model. You can modify the parameters and datasets as needed.

## Model Evaluation
Evaluate your model's performance using the scripts in src/model_evaluation.py. This includes metrics such as Mean Squared Error, R-squared, etc.

## Notebooks
Explore the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory for detailed analysis and visualization:

* **exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb:** Data exploration and visualization.
* **linear_regression_model.ipynb**: Building and training the linear regression model.
* **model_evaluation.ipynb**: Evaluating the performance of the model.
## Running Tests
Ensure code reliability by running unit tests:

'''bash

pytest tests/
